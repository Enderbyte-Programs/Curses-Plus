# What's New?

## 3.16.3

- Fix bug with some keys being untypable on windows

## NOTICE! 3.x - Breaking Changes

**The following changes likely require changes in your code**

- Move colours to a new module called constants. Because this is auto-imported, this should not pose an issue

- Move filline, showcursor, and hidecursor to a new module called utils.

- Fix spelling issue, utils.filline is now utils.fill_line

- Change displayops to optionmenu. Please refactor all calls from displayops() to optionmenu(): No other changes are required

- Remove legacy function `showerror`. Use messagebox.showerror as a replacement

- Remove legacy function `askyesno_old`. Use messagebox.askyesno as a replacement

- Combine `displaymsg` and `displaymsgnodelay` into one function

- Existing `displaymsgnodelay` calls can be changed to `displaymsg(stdscr,[messages],False)`, so change the flag wait_for_keypress to false

- Remove redundant american function `set_color`. You can either use the (correct) spelling `set_colour` or you can not use this library.


# Documentation

## transitions.py

transitions contains many transitions to add animations to your program

### __exec(func,args)

**NOTE: THIS IS AN INTERNAL FUNCTION, IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED BY THE COMMON USER**

This executes `func(args)`

### horizontal_bars(stdscr,func_to_call=None,args=(),speed=1)

This is a replacement function to old's type zero. It fills the screen from the top down with horizontal white bars. It then replaces them with black bars in the same configuration.

- `stdscr` is a curses window object

- `func_to_call` is a function. If it is set to none, no function is called

- `args` is a tuple. The tuple will be passed to the function as arguments

- `speed` is an int. A higher value increases the animation speed. A lower value (0 - 1) makes it slower. If you set speed to 0, the program will crash.

### random_blocks(stdscr,func_to_call=None,args=(),speed=1)

This is a replacement for old's type one transition. It fills random characters of the screen with blocks until the whole screen is covered, then it removes it in the same fashion.

- `stdscr` is a curses window object

- `func_to_call` is a function. If it is set to none, no function is called

- `args` is a tuple. The tuple will be passed to the function as arguments

- `speed` is an int. A higher value increases the animation speed. A lower value (0 - 1) makes it slower. If you set speed to 0, the program will crash.

### vertical_bars(stdscr,func_to_call=None,args=(),speed=1)

This is an all new transition. It functions like horizontal bars except they are vertical and go left to right.

- `stdscr` is a curses window object

- `func_to_call` is a function. If it is set to none, no function is called

- `args` is a tuple. The tuple will be passed to the function as arguments

- `speed` is an int. A higher value increases the animation speed. A lower value (0 - 1) makes it slower. If you set speed to 0, the program will crash.

## utils.py

Utils.py Contain a series of non-ui utility functions. By non-ui I mean that it does not show a screen and it is non-interactive. It is meant to enhance the creation of custom menus.

### fill_line(stdscr,line,colour)

This function fills row `line` with the colour `colour`.

- `stdscr` is a curses window object

- `line` is an int. It is the row number you wish to fill in

- `colour` is a curses colour. Use `cursesplus.set_colour()` for this

### hidecursor()

This function hides the console cursor

### showcursor()

This function shows the console cursor

## constants.py

constants.py contains a series of constants such as colours and special lines.
